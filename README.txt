3 examples of implementing Google Charts
*note: examples 2 and 3 need a xamp stack to be viewed correctly

1. Working from Google Charts API I used javascript to create 3D chart. 
2. Implementing the same chart, this time I used PHP and a helper php class that outputs javascript. 
3. Building of the first two, I implemented a Test Driven approach using Object Oriented PHP. Reading from a file I:
	*Removed all non-alpha characters and shortened array to only alpha characters. 
	*Converted array to uppercase. 
	*Removed duplicates and kept count of number of occurrences.
	*Packaged final array for php helper file
	*Called PHP and PHPhelper files to create Google Chart. 
   Note on test: letters*.txt contain varying amounts of test data.
